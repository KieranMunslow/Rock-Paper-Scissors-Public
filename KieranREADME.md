## How to run the code

Fork the repository and clone it to your local files. Open the folder and run the `cd backend` command before running `npm i`. To start the server run `nodemon server`.

Then in a separate terminal run `cd frontend` and then run another `npm i`. To start the app run the `npm start` command.
